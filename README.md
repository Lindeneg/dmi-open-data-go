**work-in-progress**

Simple [DMI API](https://confluence.govcloud.dk/display/FDAPI/Danish+Meteorological+Institute+-+Open+Data) wrapper. Heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/LasseRegin/dmi-open-data) Python library made by [Lasse Regin](https://github.com/LasseRegin) of [Woodsense](https://en.woodsense.dk/).

I'd love to use the wrapper in Go and thus why this module is being created. 

*Also, as I'm quite new to Go, any feedback is highly welcome.*

Todo:

1) Extend API support
2) Implement tests
3) Implement channels
4) Deploy package
5) Create separate CLI package
